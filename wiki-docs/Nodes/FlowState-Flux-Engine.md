# ðŸŒŠðŸš’ FlowState Flux Engine

Streamline your entire generation workflow with the FlowState Flux Engine.

An all-in-one node that seamlessly combines:
- Model, VAE, and CLIP loading (with Model Persistence to prevent subsequent reloads.)
- Prompt conditioning & guidance.
- Sage Attention model patching (for users with that capability)
- The integrated FlowState Latent Source for flexible resolution selection & easy i2i style transfer.

Reduce your node clutter and go from concept to final image faster than ever within a single, powerful engine.
