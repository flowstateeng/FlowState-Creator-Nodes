### [ðŸŒŠðŸŒ± FlowState Latent Source](https://github.com/flowstateeng/FlowState-Creator-Nodes/blob/main/FlowState_LatentSource.py)
Simplify your latent options and clean up your workflow with FlowState Latent Source.

A simple switch to select between:
 - an empty latent
 - input image as a latent
 - uploaded image as a latent
 
Vary the denoise on your sampler to control the amount of style transfer you want from your input image in your generated images.

### [ðŸŒŠðŸš’ FlowState Flux Engine](https://github.com/flowstateeng/FlowState-Creator-Nodes/blob/main/FlowState_FluxEngine.py)
Streamline your entire generation workflow with the FlowState Flux Engine.

An all-in-one node that seamlessly combines:
- Model, VAE, and CLIP loading (with Model Persistence to prevent subsequent reloads.)
- Prompt conditioning & guidance.
- Sage Attention model patching (for users with that capability)
- The integrated FlowState Latent Source for flexible resolution selection & easy i2i style transfer.

Reduce your node clutter and go from concept to final image faster than ever within a single, powerful engine.
